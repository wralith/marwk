    <p>
      This is going to be your profile page {{ userStore.username }}, but i am really not sure how
      to populate it. Favorites, activities maybe the right panel should be hidden in this page but
      i should change whole layout than. I don't know. ðŸ˜¢
    </p></template

  <template v-if="!userStore.loggedIn"
    ><h3>You don't have access to this page</h3>
    <p>How you get here!!!, I will change this implementation later ðŸ˜¢</p></template
